        Blogging is emerging as a new source of income for people with computer skills and something to say. As well as being a popular pastime for people who enjoy the interaction, successful bloggers who have come up with a good concept and attract large numbers of hits per day can also draw an income through associating themselves with an established company requesting input from bloggers, or by allowing advertising on their blogs. This has also opened up a huge opportunity for interactivity within online communities globally.
